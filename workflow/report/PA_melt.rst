Table of the mapping of the protein in the genomes. Each line correspond to an information. The format is : genome_id, genome_name, seed, PA, color, protein_id.

- genome_id: Id of the genome in NCBI
- genome_name: name of the genome in NCBI
- seed: Annotation of the protein
- PA: Number of the annotated protein find in the genome
- color: Color of the protein in the figure
- protein_id: Id of the protein in NCBI
